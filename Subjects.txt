In image processing, sampling and quantization are two processes that convert continuous sensed data into digital form:
Sampling
Digitizes the coordinate values in a signal or image. The sampling rate determines the spatial resolution of the digitized image.
Quantization
Digitizes the amplitude values in a signal or image. The quantization level determines the number of gray levels in the digitized image
